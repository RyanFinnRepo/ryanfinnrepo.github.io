  <h2>Me</h2>

  <p> I am currently enrolled at the University of North Carolina at Pembroke.
    When I was in the United States Coast Guard, I was lucky to be able to train and supervise multiple young professionals.
    I worked to diagnose and repair the onboard mechanical and electrical equipment.
    I also derived new more efficient methods to accomplish routine tasks.
    I gained experience in leadership, communications, and problem solving.
    I am looking to start a career in the Cybersecurity field. <p>

  <h2>Hobbies</h2>

  <p> I am a HAM radio operator. My favorite radio technology is software defined radio which allows my to recive and decode radio signals with my computer.
    I also enjoy working on cars in my free time.
    I have performed turbo swaps and reprogrammed the engine computer using open-source tuning software. <p>
