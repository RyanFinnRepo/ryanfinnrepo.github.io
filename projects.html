      <h2>EoD Encryption over Discord</h2>

      <p>Discord is a popular messaging platfor that got its start in the online gaming world. Since then it has grown to be a universal communication
       platform for gamers and professionals alike. One major feature that discord does not support is encryption. Information breeches
       happen everyday and cost people and companies tremendous sums of money each year.</p>
      <p>One easy way to secure information is strong encryption. By encrypting your communications through Discord you restrict the overall access
       to you communications making them harder for attackers to obtain. My on going project aims to provide a secure means for communications through
       Discord. This would open it up to be used for sensitive communications without creating any undo security risks.</p>
      <p>My project can be found on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/RyanFinnRepo/discordsecuritybot" target="_blank" >Discord Security Bot</a></p>
